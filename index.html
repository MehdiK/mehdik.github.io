            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p><strong>I will be remembered by family, friends, colleagues and the community as a trustworthy caring person who had a lasting positive impact on their lives and the lives of others.</strong></p>
       
            <p>I live a life of contribution on a foundation of the following principles:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Integrity</strong>: I honour my word.</li>
              <li><strong>Empathy</strong>: I seek to understand others and to see the world through their eyes and emotions.</li>
              <li><strong>Accountability</strong>: I take full responsibility for my health, happiness, relationships and career.</li>
              <li><strong>Curiosity</strong>: I acknowledge that I am subjective and I learn constantly.</li>
              <li><strong>Humility</strong>: I donâ€™t let my ego control me or hurt others.</li>
            </ul>

           <h2>About me</h2>

           <p>
               I started my career in the software and IT industry 20 years ago.
               I founded a company called Aram Systems to provide computer and networking services back in 97.
               I assembled computers, performed troubleshooting, setup networks and provided network administration for small companies.
               A couple of years later I joined a company as a software developer.
               Since then I have worked in three continents and with over 20 different teams and organisations wearing many different hats.
               Currently I am the Head of Software Development in Telstra Purple, the largest Australian owned technology services company.
