A few months ago, I was talking with a client about things they should consider before launching a new product we, Readify, were helping them to build. I put a list together and walked them through it.

I thought I'd document a checklist here for future reference. This list is much longer than what I provided my client, because we were already taking care of a fair bit of these for them.

What have I missed? What do you take into account for a product launch?

### User Experience
 - Before doing anything else, identify and validate the problem you're working on. [Design Thinking](https://www.ideou.com/pages/design-thinking) is your friend here.
 - Perform user/usability testing, as you start creating prototypes and develop features. I've had good experience with [User Testing](https://www.usertesting.com/services). A few things to consider for usability testing:
   - Who to test the product with?
   - Developing personas for usability testing (and early adopters)
   - How and where do you find users?
   - Prepare the usability scripts and scenarios
   - Arrange and run interviews
   - What to feed back into the roadmap and what to discount
   - Do you need confidentiality agreement for external user testing?

### Product Management
 - Use a sound product market fit process and strategy. I am a big fan of [Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/).
 - Perform a competitor analysis to see what others are doing.
 - Are you doing soft launch or big bang release? Do soft launch whenever possible.
 - Create and maintain a product roadmap. Refine the roadmap based on market analysis as well as the feedback from usability testing and early adopters.
 - Do you publish your roadmap? How far into the future? Don't commit to long term roadmap. Your roadmap will change by the time you get there.
 - How do you gather feedback from your users? How do you prioritise their feedback along new feature development?
 - What needs to be in place before you release the product to early adopters? What needs to be in place before you open the flood gates?

### Marketing
 - Find a name! Sounds kinda funny; but a lot of people fail at this. A few considerations:
   - Brainstorm around possible names
   - Google them to make sure they don't point to existing products and services or to bad press
   - Make sure the name you pick is google-able; e.g. don't name your product `go`
   - Make sure there are some domain available for that name
 - Buy your domain and consider buying a few other top layer domain names for your domain; e.g. `.com`, `.com.au`, `.net`, `.io`.
 - Define a tagline for the product.
 - Define a pricing structure and strategy. Test your pricing structure with your early adopters. Do you provide a different pricing for your early adopters?
 - Think about marketing. Do you need a landing page? Who's going to write the copy? Who's going to design the landing page? Who’s going to do SEO?
 - If you don't have this already, design a clear brand identity; i.e. colour palettes, icons, style guides etc.
 - Do you want to have a launch "party"? Do you know your launch date?
 - Consider a launch plan. Are there magazines, blogs or publications you want to target to promote the launch of your product? Have your articles, tweets etc ready in advance.
 - Do you need a social media presence?
   - What's the social media persona you want to embody?
   - Who’s going to be the social media person?
   - Who's going to write tweets and updates?
   - Do you need an approval process for new updates and responses?
   - Is the twitter handle available?

### Processes
 - How are you going to sell your product? Where can your customers find your product?
 - Can you accept payment from your customers?
 - Who’s going to provide application support for end users and how? Phone support, in-person, in-app chat, Facebook, Twitter etc?
 - Is your product used globally? If yes, (how) will you provide round the clock support?
 - How do you train your support staff with upcoming features?
 - How will you communicate changes and new features to your users?
 - Do you need to develop help, documentation or FAQ for the product? Try to aim for a product that's so user friendly it doesn't need a lot of support or training.
 - Do you have a CRM? Does it fit this product?
 - Create privacy agreements for your users
 - Create license agreement for your users/customers

### Security
 - What kind of data would you be storing - PII, PCI, PHI?
 - What sort of regulations do you need to comply with - APP, GDPR, IRAP, NEHTA etc?
 - Do you have data sovereignty requirements?
 - Consider creating a responsible disclosure policy/guideline. Checkout [Tesla's](https://www.tesla.com/about/security) for inspiration.
 - Consider bug bounty programs; e.g. [bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/bug-bounty-list/).
 - Create a data retention and destruction policy.
 - Create a data breach response policy.
 - Consider creating a BCP and DR policy.
 - Do you have a security monitoring and alerting system in place?
 - Consider performing penetration testing.
   - Do some research and find reputable pen testers.
   - Do you want to do blackbox, greybox or whitebox testing?
   - How often would you redo the test?
   - Does the vendor allow free/discounted retest if they find vulnerabilities? If yes, what's the grace period?

### Technical
 - Do you have a logging and monitoring system?
 - Can you monitor your application performance proactively?
 - Do you have health dashboards setup?
 - Can you do zero downtime release? This is much more critical if you are working on a globally used product with no "after hours".
 - What's your SLA? Do you have maintenance window? Is it communicated in the license agreement?
