**Listen** wholeheartedly, **challenge** others with respect, **commit** to a decision, and execute on that commitment regardless of whether the decision is aligned with your point of view or not. This is the only thing you need to do to create a highly productive and cohesive team.

### Listen
"*Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.*" - Stephen R. Covey

I love that quote but I think it doesn't fully reflect the reality. Most people don't even listen. They either completely tune out as the other person speaks or constantly interrupt them!

To create a productive team, at work or at home, the first and most important step is to listen. When I say *listen*, I don't mean to hear the other person. I mean listen to other person with all your senses and with empathy. Put yourself in their shoes and see the world from their point of view as you're listening to them. Be curious about their point of view, ask questions to understand their pain points, goals and feelings completely. At this point, you are not listening to agree or disagree. You are listening to fully understand and empathise with their view, even if you completely disagree with what they're saying.

Those who tune out or interrupt when other people speak have no chance of being heard and understood, and those who wholeheartedly listen to others have much higher chance of being heard and understood. Once you've heard out and understood the other person completely, it's your turn to talk about your point of view.

A lot of arguments happen because people don't listen wholeheartedly to others. It is easy to get defensive and argumentative when you feel the other person hasn't understood your point of view. Once you're completely heard and feel that the other people in the setting are committed to you and in tune with your pains and objectives, your level of trust increases and your level of defensiveness decreases significantly. So it's very critical that during this phase no one interrupts, disagrees, or even agrees. Everyone does one and only one thing: they listen intently.

### Challenge
After everyone's had a turn in presenting their point of view, you move to the second step - Challenge. Make this transition very clear and explicit. Up to this point, no one was allowed to agree, disagree or argue with others. This is your chance to challenge other person or people's point of view. The goal is not to win an argument. The goal is to build on each others' ideas and points of view or to expand your view and get buy in from the team.

Don't hold anything back in this phase. If you disagree with someone, make it known. Explain your point of view and why you disagree with them clearly and respectfully.

In a conversation, challenging, without listening, could turn into a never ending heated argument. I am sure most people can attest to such arguments with their partner. People repeat their point of view over and over again when they don't feel heard or understood. So everything I said above about listening applies just as much here. When someone's challenging, everyone needs to tune in, listen to them intently, understand their point of view and empathise with their objective, fears and uncertainties. Don't interrupt each other.

This doesn't take too long if you listen intently and speak your mind with authenticity. So don't interrupt the flow. Don't cut conversations short. It's a lot cheaper to make a right decision everyone buys into than to make a rushed one. At the same time, you should not go around the circle. Move to the next step once everyone's raised their objections and explained their point of view.

### Commit
It's time to make a decision. You could write down the outstanding ideas on post-it notes and vote and pick the highest voted idea. That is now the team's decision.

Regardless of who agreed or disagreed with the decision, **everyone should commit and execute on it like it's their own decision**. There is no argument, no challenge, no "*but I didn't agree with the decision*". Everyone has fully discussed their point of view and challenged others. You are heard and understood. The only thing that matters now is the decision made by the **team**. Roll up your sleeves and help your team execute on that idea with the best of your ability.

### But I didn't make the decision
Not every decision can be made with involvement from everyone. Many times, particularly in larger organisations, you find yourself executing a decision made by another group. What now?!

You have two choices: you can fully commit to the decision and execute it as if it was your decision, or you might choose not to commit. Let's break this down to all possible combinations:

  - It's a **great decision** and you **commit**: it can't get any better than this.
  - It's a **great decision** and you **don't commit**: you just obstructed your team and organisation from achieving its full potential. A decision or idea, no matter how great, is doomed to fail without proper commitment and execution.
  - It's a **bad decision** and you **don't commit**: you don't show any interest or commitment - you are the non-committal (and potentially whinging) type; so no one, including your boss, buys into your arguments around why it's a bad idea. The idea turns into a failure and you might be blamed for it.
  - It's a **bad decision** and you **commit**: you show your full commitment and give it your best shot even though you think (and potentially know) it's a bad decision. With full commitment, you can try multiple approaches quite rapidly and come to an objective conclusion. The committed individuals are known to teams and bosses. So when you go to your boss and say "*hey, I've tried these approaches and this doesn't seem to work. I don't think this is a good idea*", you have much higher chance of being heard and saving your company and team a lot of wasted time by proving the idea wrong, very fast.

You see - it doesn't matter if the decision you're handed is a good or a bad decision. Everyone wins when you commit and everyone loses when you don't. A team is not a team without commitment - it's a collection of individuals with personal agendas, and we've all worked in those teams. They're not fun!

### A word for the boss
It doesn't matter who you are, what your title is, how much you're paid, what you've done in the past, what you know or are capable of. You get very limited commitment, if any, from your team if you don't listen to them, even if they appear to listen and nod when you speak.

I see quite a few managers and executives who complain about lack of ownership and commitment from their team! You can't expect ownership if you constantly give orders without listening to your team.

A lot of companies move the decisions to where the information is: to higher management. Ironically, your chances of making a good decision is quite limited if you're not involved in day to day execution of it. So instead of moving the decision to where the information lives, share the information with those who execute the decisions, listen to them, challenge and coach them, make a decision with them and commit to it and execute it together.

While we're at it, put your phone aside when your team is talking with you. Your most important business is your team. You're nothing without them.
