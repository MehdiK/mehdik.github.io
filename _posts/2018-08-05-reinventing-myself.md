One night, as I was laying on my bed in early 2018 thinking about the purpose of life, a question came to mind: "*How will I feel at my death bed? What regrets will I have?*". This led me down a path of soul searching and self discovery for several months, trying to make sense of who I really am and what I really want in life.

This is the outcome of that journey, my personal mission statement, what I stand for and what I want to accomplish in my life. 

## Mission Statement
**I live a life of contribution, with integrity and empathy, and I take full responsibility for my health, happiness, relationships and career.**

When I die, I want to be remembered by family, colleagues and friends as a trustworthy caring person who had a lasting positive impact on their lives and the lives of others.

## Principles
I centre my life and every decision I make by following these principles:

 - Integrity: I honour my word.
 - Empathy: I see the world through the feelings, thoughts and experience of others.
 - Courage: I say and do what I feel is right, even when it's risky to do so.
 - Humility: I don't let my ego control me or hurt others.
 - Forgiveness: I lend a hand to the fallen, even if they fell while kicking me,

## Personal development practices
Here is a few practices that I will try and embed in my life to enable me and my mission:

 - Exercise regularly
 - Spend quality time with my wife and kids
 - Call three friends every week
 - Cultivate an attitude of mindfulless and gratitude
 - Read and write regularly
