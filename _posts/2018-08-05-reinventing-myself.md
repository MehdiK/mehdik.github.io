In the past few years, I made a few significant mistakes in my personal life and work. Each of these mistakes and experiences made me more and more confused. As the result, I found myself in a major identity crisis in early 2018. I didn't know who Mehdi was, what he was up to, what he aspired to do in his personal life and career, and what he was put on earth to accomplish. I was out of alignment with my wife, kids, family, friends and work. Being 39, I initially labelled this as mid life crisis and tried to ignore it; but the pain was too acute to ignore. I had to deal with it.

This led me down a path of self discovery and deep soul searching for the past seven months, challenging every single thing I believed in and stood for, trying to make sense of who I am and what I want in life.

It all started with one question in my head when I was laying on my bed in early 2018: "*how will I feel at my death bed and how do I want those who know me to feel about me when I'm gone?*".

This journey continues as I write this; but I feel reborn and reconnected. This is Mehdi, on the first few days of his second life. He is going to change, fumble and learn as he grows again; but all of that is going to happen on this new yet evolving foundation.

## Mission Statement
**I live a life of contribution, with integrity and empathy, and I take full responsibility for my health, happiness, relationships and career.**

When I die, I want to be remembered by family, colleagues and friends as a trustworthy caring person who had a lasting positive impact on their lives and the lives of others.

## Principles
I centre my life and every decision I make around the following principles:

 - I honour every promise I make, and I only do and say things I'd not be ashamed of if found out (Integrity),
 - I deeply understand others and see the world through their eyes and emotions (Empathy),
 - I say and do what I feel is right, with immense consideration for the other party, even when it's risky to do so (Courage),
 - I acknowledge that I am subjective and I learn constantly (Curiosity),
 - I don't let my ego control me or hurt others (Humility),
 - I do my very best in everything I commit to (Excellence),
 - I respond with smile when I can't control the outcome (Patience),
 - I don't talk or write when emotional (Emotional Intelligence),
 - I lend a hand to the fallen, even if they fell while kicking me (Forgiveness),

... and I acknowledge and apologise anytime I fail at any of these principles.

## Priorities
The following is the list of my top priorities in life:

 - My health
 - Shadi
 - Benjamin & Jasmine
 - Family
 - Work
 - Community

## Goals
It is 5th of August 2023 (five years from now):

 - Shadi and I are in love, like when we were friends
 - Benjamin and Jasmine know who they are and are growing up to live happy successful lives
 - I have a great relationship with my family
 - I have touched the hearts and changed the lives of 1000 people in a lasting positive way
 - I am healthier and happier than when I was 18
 - I have spent a lot of time travelling with Shadi and kids

I still don't know how I will achieve these goals; but the details are immaterial. I will achieve these goals.

## My journey
I did everything I could think of to pull myself out of hole I had dug myself into, with varying levels of success. This was a painful yet very enlightening journey for me. If you find yourself in a similar situation, the following is the list of things that have had the biggest influence in my journey so far. I hope this provides a bit of guidance for you:

 - Challenged everything I thought was right, very deeply.
 - Observed everything I've done and everything and everyone around me, particularly my wife and kids, very deeply.
