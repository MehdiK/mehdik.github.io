One night, as I was laying on my bed in early 2018 thinking about the purpose of life, a question came to mind: "*How will I feel at my death bed? What regrets will I have?*". This led me down a path of self discovery and deep soul searching for the seven months, challenging everything I believed in and stood for, trying to make sense of who I am and what I want in life. Later when I read *The seven habits of highly effective people* I also started thinking about how I want people to remember me when I'm gone. This journey continues; but I feel reborn and reconnected as I write this.

**I will be remembered by family, friends, colleagues and the community as a trustworthy caring person who had a lasting positive impact on their lives and the lives of others.**

I live a life of contribution on a foundation of the following principles:

 - **Integrity**: I honour my word,
 - **Empathy**: I seek to understand others and to see the world through their eyes and emotions,
 - **Accountability**: I take full responsibility for my health, happiness, relationships and career,
 - **Curiosity**: I acknowledge that I am subjective and I learn constantly,
 - **Humility**: I don't let my ego control me or hurt others,

The following practices are core part of my life: 

 - Spending quality time with my family
 - Cultivating an attitude of gratitude
 - Exercising five times a week
 - Reading two books a month
 - Fostering meaningful relationships
