I had a few major failures in my personal life and work in the last few years. As the result, I found myself in an identity crisis in the past year. I wasn't sure who Mehdi was, what he was up to, what he aspired to do in his personal life and career, and what he was put on earth to accomplish. I was out of alignment with my wife, kids, family, friends and work. Being 39, I initially tried to brush this off as mid life crisis; but then I decided to deal with it.

Then one night, as I was laying on my bed in early 2018 thinking about the purpose of life, a question came to mind: "*How will I feel at my death bed? What regrets will I have?*". This led me down a path of self discovery and deep soul searching for the past seven months, challenging everything I believed in and stood for, trying to make sense of who I am and what I want in life. Later when I read *The seven habits of highly effective people* I also started thinking about how I want those who know me to feel about me when I'm gone. This journey continues; but I feel reborn and reconnected as I write this.

This is my mission statement, what I stand for and want to accomplish in my life. I am sure I am going to change, fumble and learn as I go; but I'm going to take that journey with this new foundation.

## Mission Statement
**I live a life of contribution, with integrity and empathy, and I take full responsibility for my health, happiness, relationships and career.**

When I die, I want to be remembered by family, colleagues and friends as a trustworthy caring person who had a lasting positive impact on their lives and the lives of others.

## Principles
I centre my life and every decision I make around the following principles:

 - Integrity: I honour every promise I make, and I only do and say things I'd not be ashamed of if found out,
 - Empathy: I deeply understand others and see the world through their eyes and emotions,
 - Courage: I say and do what I feel is right, with immense consideration for the other party, even when it's risky to do so,
 - Curiosity: I acknowledge that I am subjective and I learn constantly,
 - Humility: I don't let my ego control me or hurt others,
 - Excellence: I do my very best in everything I commit to,
 - Patience: I respond with smile when I can't control the outcome,
 - Emotional Intelligence: I don't talk or write when emotional,
 - Forgiveness: I lend a hand to the fallen, even if they fell while kicking me,

... and I acknowledge and apologise anytime I fail at any of these principles.

## Priorities
The following is the list of my top priorities in life:

 - My health
 - Shadi
 - Benjamin & Jasmine
 - Family

 - Community

## Goals
