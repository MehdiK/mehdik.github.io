summary: "
Many developers have seen and used Fiddler; but the usage is usually limited to capturing HTTP traffic.

This session includes the fundamentals of Fiddler, how it works, plus some of the more advanced features including setting breakpoints and changing the request and response on the fly, auto responding to requests, using filters and so on.

Some of the topics discussed in this session will be familiar to most developers; but there is going to be a few nice tricks to take away for most.

A while back I did a presentation about Advanced Debugging with Fiddler at [DDD Brisbane][1]. Just a few days ago the presentation video aired on [SSW TV][2].

DDD sessions are limited to an hour and there was A LOT I wanted to cover; so the session is rather fast paced. I guess if I get to do this session again, I will cut out some of material in order to maintain a slower pace.

... and here is the video. Below you can also find the slides (if you want to follow them on your pace).

As mentioned in the session I have a two-part detailed article about Fiddler in which I go through some of these features. You may find them [here][3] and [here][4].

I hope you enjoy it.
