description: "There has been a bit of hype lately around microservices. You go to conferences and read blogs and all you hear is how awesome microservices architecture is. This talk is about challenges of microservices. It's about things you don't normally hear when developers talk about microservices. I hope that by highlighting these challenges, you weigh the challenges and cost of microservices against its benefits before you pick it for your next project."
