##Presentations
I really enjoy public presentation and over the years I've spoken in a handful of conferences and user groups. I've written about some of my presentations. You can find them below (some of them also included video recording of the session):

 - Microservices lessons from trenches
 - [Automated UI Testing Done Right at DDD Sydney](/presentations/automated-ui-testing-done-right-at-dddsydney)
 - [Advanced Web Debugging With Fiddler at DDD Brisbane](/advanced-web-debugging-with-fiddler)
 - [Working With Offline Web Application](/presentations/wdyk-offline-web) at What Do You Know  Night from [Web Directions](http://www.webdirections.org/) conference.

You can also find a few slidedecks on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/MehdiKhalili).

I love presenting and I always have something to talk about. If you need a presenter for your conference get in touch with me.
